An unobtrusive ruby authentication library based on ActiveRecord.
#### ðŸŸ¢ Pros

  * It is easy to use and provides a simple, clean API for handling authentication.
  * It is flexible and customizable, allowing developers to modify the behavior of the authentication process to meet their specific needs.
  * It is well documented and has an active community of developers.
  * Allows to maintain multiple sessions.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Cons

  * There is no built-in support for 2FA (two-factor authentication).
  * You need two implement all authentication logic yourself. Requires a lot of boilerplate code.
  * Tightly coupled to Rails. It is not possible to use it outside of Rails.
